It imports the Link component from "react-router-dom" for creating links to donation details.
The DonationCard component takes a prop named donationCard, which is an object containing information about a donation.
Inside the component, it destructures the donationCard object to extract properties such as title, picture, category, category_bg, card_bg, text_color, and id.
It renders a card element with the extracted information. The card has an image (retrieved from the picture property), a category label with a background color (styled using category_bg), and the donation title.
The DonationCard component is exported for use in other parts of your React application.
CSS styling is applied to various elements within the card, including background colors and text colors, based on the extracted properties.
